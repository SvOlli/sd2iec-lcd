 SD2IEC-LCD
============

This is a fork of the official [SD2IEC](https://sd2iec.de/) firmware, with
an additional branch for support of LCDs based upon the version introduced
in the
[Forum64](https://www.forum64.de/index.php?thread/74116-lcd-sd2iec-firmware-1-0-0-f%C3%BCr-larsp-layout/).
It also includes changes done by Javi M to support the C64 Version of
"Another World" and "Wings Of Fury". Original source of this is available
at [github](https://github.com/jamarju/sd2iec-anotherworld/).

Branches
--------
These branches are available in this repository:

- master: contains the original code from [sd2iec.de](https://sd2iec.de/)
- LCD: (this branch) contains the merged code for LCD versions
- c128d-internal: contains additional code for a custom C128D
  internal mounted version

Note
----
The maintainer of this repository has done this effort, because he's got
an "evo2"-variant *without* and LCD. So there is no testing possible.

Pull requests are *very* welcome and will be processed in good faith.

Special thanks to Ingo Korb and CapFuture1975 and all the others
contributing to SD2IEC. This is be no means my work. I just had the luck,
that trying to pull some pieces together worked out pretty well.
